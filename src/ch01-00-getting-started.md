# Getting Started

Let’s start your Rust® journey! There’s a lot to learn, but every journey starts
somewhere. In this chapter, we’ll discuss:

* Installing the Rust® toolchain on Linux, macOS, and Windows
* Writing a program that prints `Hello, world!`
* Using `cargo`, the package manager and build system for the Rust® programming language
